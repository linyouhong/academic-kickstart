Diamond (1997) famously argued that “fractured land” was responsible for China's tendency toward political unification and Europe's protracted political fragmentation. We build a dynamic model with granular geographical information in terms of topographical features and the location of productive agricultural land to quantitatively gauge the effects of “fractured land” on state formation in Eurasia. We find that either topography or productive land alone is sufficient to account for China's recurring political unification and Europe's persistent political fragmentation. The existence of a core region of high land productivity in Northern China plays a central role in our simulations. We discuss how our results map into observed historical outcomes and assess how robust our findings are.","tags":[],"title":"The Fractured-Land Hypothesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lin Youhong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590110731,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590110731,"objectID":"53494625610afa8f36fe008d1e1092c9","permalink":"https://linyouhong.com/publication/malaria2/","publishdate":"2020-05-22T09:25:31+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/malaria2/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper examines whether the health system disruption during the Cultural Revolution was the major factor that triggered the malaria outbreak in the early 1970s.

The data of individuals born in the coastal provinces in East and South China in 1963–1993 were merged with typhoon tracking data according to the birth time and place of each individual to identify significantly negative effects of gestational typhoon exposure on the educational attainment and annual income in adulthood. The effects were stronger for women than for men. The negative effects of typhoons became less significant after the rural reform, indicating that economic growth is crucial in mitigating the effects of natural disasters. Typhoon exposure was determined to increase pregnancy failure, suggesting that the long-term effects may be attributable to the detrimental effects of typhoon exposure on fetal development.

The data reveal a steady increase in the presence of midwives in rural China, reflecting China’s efforts to train primary care workers. By adopting an event study approach, I find the presence of midwives significantly reduced infant mortality in a commune. Economically advantaged communes experienced greater improvement in terms of primary care and a larger reduction in infant mortality rates. These beneficial health effects could not be explained by midwife delivery per se. Moreover, the age-2 mortality of children with poor health was reduced by the presence of midwives, indicating that other primary care interventions in addition to reproductive health services also helped improve health.","tags":[],"title":"Primary care and health in rural China (1960s–1970s)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Youhong Lin","Feng Liu","Peng Xu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1569118619,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569118619,"objectID":"2356e70b11421b060b62e22de16295f7","permalink":"https://linyouhong.com/publication/drought/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T10:16:59+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/drought/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper focuses on Guizhou Province, a region with difficult geographical conditions and poor economic development, to examine the effect of rainfall shocks on contemporaneous infant health and socioeconomic outcomes in China. The study results indicate that negative rainfall shocks are robustly correlated with higher infant mortality and lower birth weight. In the long run, early-life rainfall shortages limit an individual’s income and housing conditions. The study findings indicate a significant interaction of rainfall shock with the severity of water scarcity. This result implies that drinking water safety is an essential channel through which early-life rainfall shocks influence individual health endowments. However, agriculture production is not a likely channel for rainfall effects despite its association with infant mortality. Accordingly, our empirical results suggest that improving public facility coverage will reduce the vulnerability of infant health to adverse rainfall shocks in Guizhou and other developing areas.","tags":[],"title":"Effects of Drought on Infant Mortality in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Youhong Lin","Feng Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1550798731,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550798731,"objectID":"26ec66f2ea685c51b01f13c028f1432a","permalink":"https://linyouhong.com/publication/fluoride/","publishdate":"2019-02-22T09:25:31+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fluoride/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we conducted an econometric analysis to investigate the impacts of fluoride pollution on health.

The results showed that fluoride pollution from coal burning significantly increases the diastolic and systolic blood pressure levels of adults. And the pollution also leads to higher likelihood of underweight. Our further analysis indicated that fluoride pollution from coal burning during the infant period greatly reduces the height and weight of children in their childhood and adolescence periods. We also explore the mechanism by investigating the influence of fluoride pollution exposure on birthweight and find evidence that fluoride pollution had a negative impact on prenatal development.","tags":[],"title":"Indoor air quality and health: Empirical evidence from fluoride pollution in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Youhong Lin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1550798731,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550798731,"objectID":"6f1fb6281ce568f63e71e403c13a039f","permalink":"https://linyouhong.com/publication/malaria/","publishdate":"2019-02-22T09:25:31+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/malaria/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper studies the effects of malaria control on the health of pregnant women and infants in 1960s and 1970s China by using the China In-depth Fertility Survey of Guangdong.

However, the impartiality of the merit-based selection process could be damaged by the top officials in the central government. This paper examines the favoritism in the imperial examination of the Ming dynasty. The results find that examinees from the same prefecture or the same province as the grand secretaries were more likely to obtain higher tiers of the jinshi degree in the palace examination and they were more likely to be selected as the interns in the Hanlin Academy, which guaranteed them more promising official careers. The senior grand secretary had larger influence than the secondary grand secretaries. The favoritism from the grand secretaries was also limited by the bureaucracy as the study finds limited influence of the grand secretaries on the lower metropolitan exams. Therefore, China's meritocracy was impaired by the favoritism in the civil service examination system.","tags":[],"title":"Favoritism in Meritocracy: Evidence from the Chinese Imperial Examination in Ming Dynasty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Youhong Lin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519262731,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519262731,"objectID":"87439f241865daa44227d561de7e245d","permalink":"https://linyouhong.com/publication/iodine/","publishdate":"2018-02-22T09:25:31+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/iodine/","section":"publication","summary":"Iodine deficiency is a serious disease that could threaten people's intelligence development and inhibit the economic growth in China.

The estimation of difference-in-difference model shows that: the crop yield per mu and total crop output both witness significantly faster increase from 1960s to 1970s in regions with higher density of tube well in 1970. Besides, the construction of tube well significantly alleviates the negative effect of precipitation abnormality (drought or heavy rainfall) on crop production. The important role of groundwater on agricultural development is confirmed by using the water abundance underground as instrument variable. On the aspect of the channels of the effect of groundwater, we find the exploitation of groundwater not only raises the irrigation ratio of cultivated land, but also decreases the size of salt-affected land. Thus, the exploitation of groundwater is an important force that promote the agricultural development in China.","tags":[],"title":"The Revolution of Water Resource: Exploitation of Groundwater and Agricultural Development in China (1963-1978)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nan Li","Youhong Lin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467339223,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467339223,"objectID":"311f9bc2b0a2cf944e2303c46d1d6393","permalink":"https://linyouhong.com/publication/governance/","publishdate":"2016-07-01T10:13:43+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/governance/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper studies the short-term and the long-term economic consequence of Qing's policy of bureaucratization of native officers in Southwest China. We find that, in Qing Dyansty, the population density and human capital are both higher in those regions which were transformed into the direct governance than those regions which were not. These reuslts have persistence effect after Qing Dyansty. In 1990, the population density, average income of rural residences, and infant survival rate are higher in those regions which were transformed into the direct governance earlier in Qing Dynasty than those which were transformed later. The positive effect of the policy on economic development was caused by both the immigration from the inland after political intergration, and more efficient provision of public good by the local government. Thus, this paper not only provides empirical evidence for Machiavelli's governance problem in a culturally heterogeneous nation, but also proposes new direction for understanding the economic inequality in the frontier.","tags":[],"title":"Bureaucratic Governance and Econmimc Development: A Historical Investigation of Southwest China in Qing Dynasty","type":"publication"}]
